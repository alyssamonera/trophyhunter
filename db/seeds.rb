The trick is to connect up the dots in a certain order, so that you create the correct image. Think of constellations in the real world like The Plough or Orion''s Belt for an idea of what''s going on here. While these challenges start off easily enough, they get increasingly trickier as you work through the whole series. It''s worth the effort though, as once you''ve solved each set of three, you''ll be guided towards a cave containing lots of delicious equipment. We''ve put together a quick guide - with fancy diagrams and everything - so you can tick them off in short order, and hoover up that lovely loot. If you''re looking for a more general guide to Dragon Age Inquisition, we''ve already put together a walkthrough for the core story, along with plenty of hints and tips for getting the most out of your Rogues, Warriors and Mages.",

  "body" => "Each week in Fortnite, a new Loading Screen can be unlocked by completing certain challenges. If you view these loading screens closely, it actually hints at the location of a secret Battle Star or Banner location on the map. Secret Battle Stars and Loading Screens work a little differently in Fortnite Season X. Instead of being tied to completing all Challenges in a specific week, they now appear as part of time-limited Challenges - making them easier to unlock and locate. Here''s examples of what they look like from time-limited challenges from the first two weeks (thanks ItzBullzye on reddit and itsZBG on reddit for these): Finding additional Battle Stars in the game will then give you an additional Tier towards your Season Battle Pass progress. You can also pick up new Banners, which will give you new customisation options. Like previous loading screen rewards, you need to have unlocked that specific loading screen before it will appear on the map. Since these only appear for a limited time, make sure you get it in your inventory before it disappears. But once you have it, you have until the end of the season to get it. Likely because of this, it appears there is no end-of-season bonus skin that will unlock for finding them all. Seasons 4 to 9 had these skins, named The Visitor, The Enforcer, AIM, The Prisoner and Ruin and Singularity respectively. As always, you have until the end of the Season to unlock the various Utopia loading screens and skin, otherwise it''ll be gone forever. Good luck!",

  You join Jesse Faden as she enters the mysteriously sinister Federal Bureau of Control in search for her younger brother, Dylan. The Bureau, however, is under attack from a force only known as the Hiss, whose motives are unknown.
  Jesse finds herself taking on the position of Director - the Head of Federal Bureau of Control. This makes her the only person who can stop the Hiss and she''s not even getting paid. Control is divided up into a series of main missions.
  Each mission will take you to a new area in the Oldest House, the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control, as you try to stop the Hiss and find Dylan. Both the Hiss and a variety of puzzles, however, will try to stop you in your tracks.
  Always stay on the move in combat. Combat in Control is fast and, if you get stuck in a corner, you can find yourself dead very quickly. For this reason, it''s a good idea to stay on the move, dodging bullets and throwing chairs at enemy Hiss.
  Deconstruct any unwanted mods. Deconstructing unwanted Personal and Weapon Mods will supply you with a small amount of Source Energy. You can then use this Source Energy to build new Weapon Forms for your Service Weapon to help you take out the Hiss.
  Collect as many collectables as you can. The Oldest House is full of collectables for you to find. Some are small easter eggs, others hint at dark events in the Bureau''s past and a few will unlock new Side Missions for you to complete.",

A ''live'' version of regular player cards in FUT, Ones to Watch add an intriguing option for players both on the pitch and in the ever-changing FUT Transfer Market, tracking players form over time. The key here will be picking the players who you feel will hit the greatest run of form this season. Wan-Bissaka, for instance, has had a very strong start for Manchester United, as has Joao Félix at Atletico Madrid. Keep a close eye on the values of the OTW cards that are the only ones for their position, like Wan-Bissaka so far - not because they''re likely to have better seasons than anyone else, but because they could get a potentially dispriportionate boost to their value on the transfer market.",

  It sees the return of original Destiny''s Outbreak Prime as the renamed Outbreak Perfected, but thankfully this time the quest is a lot more straightforward to complete.
  That said, it''s not easy. Though the first half of the quest can be completed solo, the second and final half is an intense, lengthy mission that requires a dedicated Fireteam and lots of practice. Hope you''re ready for a challenge! Scan the device within The Rig on Titan. Visit six Lost Sectors and find Fallen Transponder nodes. Visit The Farm and find the quest giver. Complete the Zero Hour mission within the time limit. With that done, Outbreak Perfected is yours. To start the Outbreak Perfected quest in Destiny 2, head to Titan''s The Rig fast travel point, and head south across a bridge. This will take you to Tidal Anchor. From here, it''s a fairly linear if winding stretch of corridors through the area, past a section with consoles and screens above them.",

The provisions they supply will be dotted around that location - for example, food to the left of where you check in with Pearson, or ammo round the back of Arthur''s tent.
  Remember, you need to stock up these provisions through the ledger if you use them up, and each upgrade will mean this restock will cost more.",
